# Made the Project Using Vite and React JS
Built a simple mobile responsive recipe calculator that uses my own build JSON file rest api and displays it up . Also clicking on the "Want to Cook" button adds it on the button list and then clicking on the "Preparing" removes it from the list and adds it to cooking list and total time and total calorie is calculated and shown.

Technologies used: HTML , CSS , JavaScript , ES6 , Rest API , React JS
